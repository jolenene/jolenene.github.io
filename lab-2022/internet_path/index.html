        <h2>A healing journey guided by koolkat, your internet friend.</h2>
        <pre>
                'KoolKat' was a character I made up randomly when I was feeling down. 
                He is blue, with a star on his chest. He is modeled after 'Doraemon', a 
                cartoon character from my childhood. The character is shown to always have
                a solution to every problem, and I want my avatar to be the same as well.</pre>
        <h2>Process of Development</h2>
            <pre> 
                The character was drawn when I was doodling to take my mind off of stuff that made me sad.
                I ran into some trouble having the button display three external link buttons at once, but 
                later on figured out how to use jquery to do it.
                 <ul>process:
                <li>doodle</li>
                <li>try out different colors</li>
                <li>add star to chest</li>
                <li>animate background</li>
                <li>animate kat</li>
                <li>create divs</li>
                <li>use jquery to put three divs into one responsive div</li>
                </ul>
                </pre>
                <h2>Reflections on the Project</h2>
                <pre>
            It was gratifying seeing the pop-up buttons work. I had wanted to make something
                 like that for so long and finally succeeded. The animating took a long time and
              was a little difficult. So was getting every div in the correct order and making
                 sure all the links worked. The gif buttons were a success. I learned how to use jquery,
                 which was very satisfying.
